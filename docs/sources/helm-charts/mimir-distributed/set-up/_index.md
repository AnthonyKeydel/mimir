# Set up Grafana Mimir using the Helm chart

The Grafana Mimir [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart allows you to configure, install, and upgrade Grafana Mimir within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Before you begin

The instructions that follow are common across any flavor of Kubernetes. They also assume that you know how to install a Kubernetes cluster, and configure and operate it.

It also assumes that you have an understanding of what the `kubectl` command does.

> **Caution:** This procedure is primarily aimed at local or development setups. To set up in a production environment, see [Run Grafana Mimir in production using the Helm chart]({{< relref "prepare-production-environment/run-production-environment-with-helm/" >}}).

### Hardware requirements

- A single Kubernetes node with a minimum of 4 cores and 16GiB RAM

### Software requirements

- Kubernetes 1.20 or higher
- The `kubectl` command for your version of Kubernetes
- Helm 3 or higher

### Verify that you have

- Access to the Kubernetes cluster
- Persistent storage is enabled in the Kubernetes cluster, which has a default storage class set up. You can [change the default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/).
- DNS service works in the Kubernetes cluster
- An ingress controller is set up in the Kubernetes cluster, for example [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)

> **Note:** Although this is not strictly necessary, if you want to access Mimir from outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you will need an ingress. This procedure assumes you have an ingress controller set up.
